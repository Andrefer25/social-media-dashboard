## Social media dashboard with theme switcher

The client has requested you to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible, keeping in mind simplicity and ease-of-use.

Deliver the complete experience using React (you can use Create React App), any CSS-in-JS library (Emotion, Styled Components, etc) or tools you see fit and any other tools you like to help you complete the task. 

The Dashbord should display correctly in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile; you'll only receive a desktop mockup. On mobile, the user should to be able to view as much information on the screen as posible, without losing the design's coherence. 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Toggle color theme to their preference

- View more information about a specific social media account through a modal. For the chart, the team has agreed on using the following library: https://recharts.org/en-US/examples/SimpleLineChart


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Deliverables

- Complete project files working on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge and project's documentation.
